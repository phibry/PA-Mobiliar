In this section models were created trying to outperform the buy and hold strategy.
starting with the usage of the simplest models , diffrent aproaches were chosen to fullfill the goal.

### 3.1. Time-Series Analysis {#ts-analysis}

Plots of the timeseries, decomposition. Stationarity (refer to the theory section)

### 3.2 using simple methods
