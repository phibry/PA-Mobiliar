## 3. Methodology

In this section models were created trying to outperform the buy and hold strategy.
starting with the usage of the simplest models , diffrent aproaches were chosen to fullfill the goal.



### 3.1. Time-Series Analysis {#ts-analysis}

Plots of the timeseries, decomposition. Stationarity (refer to the theory section)

### 3.2 using simple methods


```{r chap3.2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="conversion data"}

load("data/data_mobi") 
n=20
k=2
chartSeries(data[,1],subset="2007-05::2009-01",theme=chartTheme("white"),name= "bollinger bands",type="")
addBBands(n=n,sd=k,maType = "SMA", draw = 'bands', on = -1)
```
