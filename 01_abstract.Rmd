## Abstract

In this project 4 timeseries are investigated with quantitative methods.With different technical approaches we try to outperform the well established and often used buy and hold strategy. At the beginning the used theory is explained superficially. In the search for the best parameters, specific optimizations are calculated according to three approaches and the results are discussed.
